# List Operations
The item at a certain index in a list can be reassigned.

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[1] = 5

print(nums)
```
```
[1, 5, 3]
```

Lists can also be added the same way strings can be

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(nums + [4, 5, 6])
```
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Lists and strings share a lot of similarities - you can basically think of strings as lists of characters that can't be changed.
Similar to strings, a list can be multiplied by an integer

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(nums * 5)
```
```
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

> This repeats the list the specified number of times


To check if an item is in a particular list, we can use the in operator.

It returns True if the item occurs one or more times in the list, and False if it doesn't.

```python
words = ["me", "and", "you", "me"]
print("me" in words)
print("you" in words)
print("they" in words)
```
```
True
True
False
```

The **in** operator is also used to determine whether or not a string is a substring of another string.

```python
x = "Python is easy"

if "Python" in x:
    print("Yes")
```
```
Yes
```

To check if an item is not in a list, you can use the **not** operator in one of the following way

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(not 4 in nums)
print(4 not in nums)
print(not 3 in nums)
print(3 not in nums)
```
```
True
True
False
False
```
