# In-Place Operators
**In-place operators** let you write code like **'x = x + 5'** more concisely, as **'x += 5'**

```python
x = 5
print(x)

x += 3
print(x)
```
```
5
8
```

In-place operators can be used for any numerical operation (+, -, *, /, %, **, //).

```python
x = 10

x -= 4
print(x)

x /= 2
print(x)

x **= 3
print(x)
```
```
6
3.0
27.0
```
You can also use in-place operators for string concatenation

```python
x = 'spam'
print(x)

x += "bro"
print(x)
```
```
spam
spambro
```

With the variables, input & operators we can make more complex program.

For example, let's make a program that takes miles as input and outputs the corresponding km value

```python
miles = int(input("Enter Miles: "))
km = miles * 1.60934

print("The km is: " + str(km))
```
```
Enter Miles: 20
The km is: 32.1868
```
