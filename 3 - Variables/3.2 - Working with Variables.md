# Working with Variables
We can perform operations with variables.

```python
num1 = 3
print(num1)
print(num1 + 4)
print(num1 + num1)
print(num1)
```
```
3
7
6
3
```

> The variable stores its value throughout the program.

We can change the value of a variable; Variables can be reassigned as many times as you want

```python
z = 163.5
print(z)

z = "OMG"
print(z + "!")
```
```
163.5
OMG!
```
> Overwriting the same variable with different data types is generally not a good practice. To avoid mistakes, try to avoid doing it.

A program can include multiple variables, which can be used together to produce a result.

```python
x = "Mad"
y = 10

print(x * y)
```
```
MadMadMadMadMadMadMadMadMadMad
```

You can use the **del** statement to remove a variable.

```python
x = 123
del x
print(x)
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\*.py", line 3, in <module>
    print(x)
          ^
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

> Trying to use the deleted variable causes an error.

Deleted variables can be reassigned.

```python
x = 123
del x
x = 456
print(x)
```
```
456
```
