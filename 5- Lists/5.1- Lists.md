# Lists
**Lists** are used to store items.
We can create a list by using **square brackets** with **commas** separating items.

```python
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
```

> This list contains three string items: Hello, world and !

To access a certain item in the list, you can do this by using its index in square brackets.

```python
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
print(words[0])
print(words[1])
print(words[2])
```
```
Hello
world
! 
```

> The first list item's index is 0, rather than 1

Lists can hold different data types, such as strings and numbers.

```python
x = ["a", "b", "c"]
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(x[1])
print(y[4])
```
```
b
5
```

We can use nested lists to represent 2D grids, such as matrices

```python
x = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6]
    ]
```

This is useful because a matrix-like structure can allow you to store data in row-column format, like in ticketing programs, that need to store the seat numbers in a matrix, with their corresponding rows and numbers.

To access the elements of a matrix, we specify the row and the column of the item using square brackets

```python
x = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6]
    ]

print(x[1][1])
```
```
5
```

> It outputs the 2nd item of the 2nd row

# Strings
Strings can be indexed like lists too!

Indexing a string is like creating a list containing each character in the string

```python
str = "Hello world!"
print(str[8])
```
```
r
```

Space (" ") is also a symbol and has an index
