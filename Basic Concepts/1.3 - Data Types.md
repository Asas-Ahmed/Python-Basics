# Data Types
Each value in Python has a **type**.

Text in quotes, like "Hello World" is called a **string**.
> we can use single or double quotes to create **strings**

## Integers

Whole numbers are called **integers**.

We can output integers with the **print** statement:
```python
print(7)
```
```
7
```
You can add, subtract and multiply integers, producing another integer as a result.
```python
print(4 + 4 - 2 * 4)
```
```
0
```

## Floats

dividing two integers produces a decimal, which is called a float.
```python
print(8 / 4)
```
```
2.0
```
You can perform mathematical operations with floats, just like with integers
```python
print(12.45 * 6)
print(7.5 + 12)
```
```
77.19
19.5
```
> When you add an integer to a float, the result is always a float.
