# Functions
A **function** is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.
> Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable

A function has a **name** and can have **arguments**
```python
print('hi')
```
```
hi
```
> Here, **print** is the function name and **"Hi"** is the argument

There are many built-in functions in Python. here are some examples...

```python
print('Hello World!')
range(2,10)
str(10)
range(10,20,2)
```

Functions can have multiple arguments.
For example, **range(2, 10)** has two arguments, **2** and **10**

> Function arguments need to be separated by **commas**

You **call** the function by using its name, followed by **parentheses**, which enclose the arguments.

For example, we call the **print** function with a string argument to generate output
```python
print("Blah blah!")
```
