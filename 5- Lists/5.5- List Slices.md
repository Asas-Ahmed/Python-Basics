# List Slices
**List slices** allow you to get a part of the list using two colon-separated indices. This returns a new list containing all the values between the indices
```python
squares = [0,4,12,51,74,12,43,96,12]
print(squares[2:6])
print(squares[3:8])
print(squares[0:1])
```
```
[12, 51, 74, 12]
[51, 74, 12, 43, 96]
[0]
```
> Just like the arguments to **range**, the first index provided in a slice is included in the result, but the second isn't

If the first number in a slice is omitted, it’s taken to be the start of the list

```python
squares = [0,4,12,51,74,12,43,96,12]
print(squares[:7])
```
```
[0, 4, 12, 51, 74, 12, 43]
```

If the second number is omitted, it’s taken to be the end

```python
squares = [0,4,12,51,74,12,43,96,12]
print(squares[7:])
```
```
[96, 12]
```
Just like with ranges, your list slices can include a third number, representing the **step**, to include only alternate values in the slice
```python
squares = [0,4,12,51,74,12,43,96,12]
print(squares[::2])
print(squares[2:8:3])
```
```
[0, 12, 74, 43, 12]
[12, 12]
```
**Negative** values can also be used in list slicing (as well as normal list indexing).

Which means that when negative values are used for the first and second values in a slice (or a normal index), they count from the end of the list
```python
squares = [0,4,12,51,74,12,43,96,12]
print(squares[1:-1])
```
```
[4, 12, 51, 74, 12, 43, 96]
```
> If a negative value is used for the step, the slice will be done backwards

Using **[::-1]** as a slice is a common and idiomatic way to reverse a list.
```python
nums = [1,5,6,75,0]
res = nums[::-1]
print(res)
```
```
[0, 75, 6, 5, 1]
```
