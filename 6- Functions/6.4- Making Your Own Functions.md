# Funtions
We can create your own functions by using the **def** statement

Here’s an example of a function named **my_func**. It takes no arguments, and prints "my" three times
```python
def my_func():
    print("my")
    print("my")
    print("my")
```
Just like with **if** statements, the code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented

So once we’ve defined a function, we can **call** it multiple times in your code
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello world!")

hello()
hello()
hello()
```
```
Hello world!
Hello world!
Hello world!
```
> We call a function using its name and the parentheses

The function needs to be defined before it can be called. Calling a function before its definition will cause an error

```python
hello()

def hello():
    print("Hello world!")
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\*.py", line 1, in <module>
    hello()
    ^^^^^
NameError: name 'hello' is not defined. Did you mean: 'help'?
```
