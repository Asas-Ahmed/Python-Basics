# Input
Some programs need to take **input** from the user.

The **input()** function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a **string**.

```python
x = input()
print(x)
```

Even if the user enters a number as input, it's processed as a **string**

```python
x = input()
print("You entered: " + x)
print(type(x))
```
```
5
You entered: 5
<class 'str'>
```

The input statement needs to be followed by parentheses.

```python
age = input()
print("Your age is: " + age)
```
```
18
Your age is: 18
```

You can provide a string to **input()** between the parentheses, producing a prompt message.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print('Welcome, ' + name)
```
```
Enter your name: Bob
Welcome, Bob
```

> The prompt message tells the user what input the program is requesting – so it’s important to make sure it’s clear.
