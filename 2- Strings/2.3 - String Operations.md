# Concatenation

In Python math works with words as well as numbers.

So not only can we add integers and floats, but also strings, using something called concatenation, which can be done on any two strings.

```python
print("My" + ' apples')
```
```
My apples
```

Strings containing numbers are still added as strings rather than integers.

```python
print('1' + '1')
```
```
11
```

> Don’t try to add a string to a number! Even though they might look similar, they are two different entities, so doing this will break the code and produce an error.

# String Operations

You may not be able to add strings to integers, but you can multiply by them!

Multiplying a string by an integer, produces a repeated version of the original string.

```python
print("Spamming!" * 3)
print(5 * "3")
```
```
Spamming!Spamming!Spamming!
33333
```

Don’t try to multiply a string by another string. This will just generate an error.

```python
print("Me" * "You")
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...\*.py", line 1, in <module>
    print("Me" * "You")
          ~~~~~^~~~~~~
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
```
> The same will happen if you try to multiply a string by a float, even if the float is a whole number.

> You can add strings together using the plus operator, as well as multiply a string with an integer, resulting in a repeated version of the string.
