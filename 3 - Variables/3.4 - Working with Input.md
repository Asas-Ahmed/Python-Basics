# Input

So The input() function returns a string. But what if we need it to be something else, like a number? let's do this!

Let's assume weâ€™ve taken the age of the user as an input.

To convert it to a number, we can use the int() function
```python
age = int(input())
print(age)
print(type(age))
```
```
5
5
<class 'int'>
```
> This will turn it from a string to an integer.

Similar to the **int()** function, the **float()** function converts a string to a float

```python
height = float(input())
print(height)
print(type(height))
```
```
140.3
140.3
<class 'float'>
```

Sometimes there is a need to use a number in a string concatenation.

This can be done using the **str()** function, which converts a number to a string.

```python
age = 31
print("His age is " + str(age))
```
```
His age is 31
```

You can use **input()** multiple times to take multiple user inputs.

```python
name = input("What is your name: ")
age = input("What is your age: ")

print("\nYour name is: " + name + "\nAge is: " + age)
```
```
What is your name: John
What is your age: 44

Your name is: John
Age is: 44
```
