# Exponentiation
Two asterisks ** are used to raise a number to the power of another, which is called **exponentiation**.

```python
print(2**3)
```
```
8
```

You can chain exponentiations together.
In other words, you can raise a number to a power, which can also be raised to a power.

```python
print(2**3**2)
```
```
512
```

We can also use **floats** in exponentiation.

```python
print(9 ** (1 / 2) )
```
```
3.0
```
> The result will be a float.

# Floor Division

As we have seen, dividing two numbers always produces a **float**.
In case we want to find the quantity produced by the division of two numbers as an integer (also called the **quotient**), we can use the floor division operator //

```python
print(25 // 6)
```
```
4
```

> The code above will output 4, because 6 goes into 25 four times.

# Remainder

If we want to find only the remainder in a division, we use the **modulo** operator %

```python
print(25 % 6)
```
```
1
```
# Quotient & Remainder

We can also use the floor division and modulo operators with floats

```python
print(25.5 % 7.25)
print(61.3 // 8.9)
```
```
3.75
6.0
```
