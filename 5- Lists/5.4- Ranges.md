# Range
Python makes it super easy to create number sequences using the **range()** function.

By default, it starts from 0, increments by 1 and stops **before the specified number**.

This code generates a list containing all of the integers, up to 20

```python
numbers = range(20)
```

In order to output the range as a list, we need to explicitly convert it to a list, using the **list()** function

```python
numbers = list(range(20))
print(numbers)
```
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
```

If **range** is called with one argument, it’ll produce an object with values from 0 to that argument.

If it’s called with two arguments, it’ll produce values from the first to the second

```python
numbers = list(range(2,10))
print(numbers)
```
```
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

> The second argument is not included in the range, so **range(2, 10)** won’t include the number 10


There’s also a third argument you can use with **range()**, It’s called **Step** and it determines the interval of the sequence produced

```python
numbers = list(range(8,20,2))
print(numbers)
```
```
[8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

To go backward We need to create a list of decreasing numbers, using a negative number as the third argument

```python
numbers = list(range(10,2,-1))
print(numbers)
```
```
[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
```

You can use ranges in **for** loops, without the need to convert them into lists. It’s commonly used to repeat some code a certain number of times

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("hi!")
```
```
hi!
hi!
hi!
hi!
hi!
```
