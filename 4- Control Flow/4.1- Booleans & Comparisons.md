# Booleans
Booleans can have two values: True and False.

We can create Booleans by comparing values, by using the equal operator ==

```python
boolean_1 = True
print(boolean_1)
True

print(5 == 10)
False

print("hi" == "hi")
True
```
```
True
False
True
```

> Be careful not to confuse assignment (one equal sign) with comparison (two equal signs)

The Boolean data type has one of only two possible values: True and False.
Note, that the values must start with a capital letter.

```python
opened = True
closed = False
```

# Comparison
Booleans are created when comparing values. Python has a number of comparison operators: equal to ==, not equal to !=, greater than >, smaller than <, greater or equal to >=, smaller or equal to <=

```python
x = 10

print(x != 5)
print(x > 6)
print(x < 3)
print(x >= 10)
print(x <= 10)
```
```
True
True 
False
True 
True
```

> Comparison operators are also called **Relational operators**

Greater than and smaller than operators can also be used to compare strings lexicographically (the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters).

```python
print('a' < 'b')
print("John" > "Matt")
```
```
True
False
```

The True and False Boolean values can be represented as integers 1 and 0, respectively.

```python
x = (10 > 5)
print(int(x))
```
```
1
```

> Note, that we used the int() function to convert the Boolean to an integer
