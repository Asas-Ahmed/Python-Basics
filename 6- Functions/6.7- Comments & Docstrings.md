# Comments
**Comments** are annotations to code used to make it easier to understand. They don't affect how code is run.

In Python, a comment is created by inserting an **octothorpe** (otherwise known as a number sign or hash symbol: #). All text after it on that line is ignored
```python
x = 450
y = 8

print(x % y) # find the remainder
```
```
2
```
You can have multiple comments in your code
```python
x = 450
y = 8
# here a comment

print(x % y) # find the remainder
# print (x // y)
# another comment
```
```
2
```
# Docstrings
**Docstrings** (documentation strings) are similar to comments, in that they’re designed to explain code. But, they’re more specific and have a different syntax.

They’re created by putting a multiline string containing an explanation of the function below the **function's first line**
```python
def shout(word):
    """
    Print a word with an
    question mark following it.
    """
    print(word + "?")
shout("Where")
```
```
Where?
```
**Docstrings** act as documentation for other developers who use your function
> Unlike conventional comments, docstrings are retained throughout the runtime of the program. This allows the programmer to inspect these comments at run time
