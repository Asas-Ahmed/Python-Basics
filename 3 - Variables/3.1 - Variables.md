# Variables
A variable lets you store a value by assigning it to a name. The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program.
> For example, in game development, you would use a variable to store how many points the player has scored.

To assign a variable, use **one equals sign**

```python
user = "michael"
```

> Above we assigned string "michael" to a variable called user.

The equal sign is called the assignment operator and is used to assign a value to a variable.

You can assign any type of value to your variable

```python
x = "Hero"
y = 7
z = 1.5
```
# Variable Names

You can use letters, numbers, and underscores in variable names. But you canâ€™t use special symbols, or start the name with a number.

> Python is a case sensitive language. Which means Lastname and lastname are two different variable names
