# Arguements
Functions can take **arguments**, which can be used to generate the function output
```python
def exclamation(word):
    print(word + "!")

exclamation("Yo")
```
```
Yo!
```
> Here, the argument is defined inside the parentheses and is named **word**

You can call the same function with different arguments
```python
def exclamation(word):
    print(word + "!")

exclamation("hi")
exclamation("insane")
exclamation("python")
```
```
hi!
insane!
python!
```
> Arguments are used to pass information to the function. This allows us to reuse the function logic for different values

Even better, you can define functions with more than one argument; separate them with commas
```python
def print_sum_twice(x, y):
    print(x + y)
    print(x + y)

print_sum_twice(7, 5)
```
```
12
12
```
In the previous examples, arguments can be used as variables inside the function
> You can have different statements in your functions, working with the argument variables, such as **if** statements and **loops**
