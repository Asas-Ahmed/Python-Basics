# if Statements
One thing you can do with Booleans is use **if** statements to run code based on a certain condition, say, if the Boolean evaluates to **True**.

```python
if condition:
    statements
```

Python uses **indentation** (that empty space at the beginning of a line) to delimit blocks of code.

Depending on the program's logic, indentation can be mandatory.

> The statements in the **if** should be indented.

```python
x = 50
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```
```
x is greater than 5
```

The colon at the end of the expression in the if statement is important, don’t leave it out.

```python
age = 20

if age > 18:
    print("Awesome!")
```
```
Awesome!
```

Sometimes we’ll have to perform more complex checks. if statements can be nested, one inside the other.

```python
num = 15
if num > 5:
    print("Bigger than 5")
    if num <= 20:
        print("Between 5 and 20")
```
```
Bigger than 5
Between 5 and 20
```
> Indentation is used to define the level of nesting.
