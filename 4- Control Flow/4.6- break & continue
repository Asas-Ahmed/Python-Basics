# break
To end a while loop prematurely, we can use a break statement.

For example, we can break an infinite loop if some condition is met:

```python
i = 0
while True:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
    if i >= 5:
        print("Breaking")
        break

print("Finished")
```
```
0
1
2
3
4
Breaking
Finished
```

An infinite while loop can be used to continuously take user input. 

For example, you are making a calculator and need to take numbers from the user to add together and stop when the user enters **"stop"**

In this case, the **break** statement can be used to end the infinite loop when the user input equals "stop"

> Using the break statement outside of a loop causes an error

# continue
Unlike **break, continue** jumps back to the top of the loop, rather than stopping it. Basically, the **continue** statement stops the current iteration and continues with the next one.

```python
i = 0
while i<5:
    i += 1
    if i == 5:
        print("Skipping 3")
        continue
print(i)
```
```
Skipping 3
5
```
