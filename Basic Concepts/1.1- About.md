# Output
The print command is the easiest way to send a specified message to the screen or other display device. This message or output can be a number, text, or the result of a calculation.
```python
print(7)
```
```
7
```
> The print command is always followed by parentheses containing the output we want to send to the screen.
# Printing Text
Computers treat text and numbers differently. When printing text outputs, you need to enclose the text in either single or double quotes
```python
print("Welcome to Python")
print('World!')
```
```
Welcome to Python!
```
