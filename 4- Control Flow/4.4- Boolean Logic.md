# Boolean Logic
Booleans with operators, which allow us to combine multiple conditions.

Letâ€™s start with the **and** operator. It is **True**, if both conditions evaluate to **True**

```python
print(5 == 5 and 6 == 6)
True
print(5 == 5 and 6 == 7)
False
print(5 != 5 and 6 == 6)
False
print(6 < 5 and 8 > 11)
False
```
```
True
False
False
False
```
besides values, you can also compare variables to form conditions

```python
age = 20
limit = 18
height = 190

if (age > limit and height > 180):
    print("Yes")
```
```
Yes
```

You can chain multiple conditional statements in an if statement using the Boolean operators.

```python
country = "Canada"
age = 40

if(country == "Canada" or country == "US") and (age > 0 and age < 100):
    print("Incredible!")
```
```
Incredible!
```

Python's order of operations is the same as that of normal mathematics: parentheses first, then exponentiation, then multiplication/division, and then addition/subtraction.

# Boolean Or
Now **or operator**.

The **or** operator is **True** if either (or both) of its conditions are **True**, and **False** if both conditions are **False**

```python
print(5 == 5 or 6 == 6)
True
print(5 == 5 or 6 == 7)
True
print(5 != 5 or 6 == 6)
True
print(6 < 5 or 8 > 11)
False
```
```
True
True 
True 
False
```

# Boolean Not
The **not operator** works a little differently. **not** takes just one argument, and inverts it.

The result of **not True** is **False**, and **not False** goes to **True**

```python
print(not 5 == 5)
False
print(not 5 > 10)
True
```
```
False
True
```
