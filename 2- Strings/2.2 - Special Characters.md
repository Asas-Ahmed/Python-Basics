# Newlines
The backslash is also used to create new lines in text.
To create a new line we use **\n**

```python
print("First \nSecond \nThird")
```
```
First 
Second
Third
```

\n is useful, but it can be cumbersome if we're trying to format lots of multiline text.

Newlines are automatically added for strings created using three quotes.

```python
print("""So
this is
a multiline
text!""")
```
```
So
this is
a multiline
text!
```
> This makes it easier to format long, multi-line texts without the need to explicitly put \n for line breaks.

# Three Quotes
When you use three quotes to create text, quotes do not need to be escaped

```python
print('''
It's my eating time.
but I don't have food!
''')
```
```

It's my eating time.  
but I don't have food!

```

# Tab
Similar to a new line, we can create a tab using **\t**

```python
print("\t Yo Wassup?")
```
```
    Yo Wassup?
```

# Carriage Return
\r is the carriage return symbol

```python
print("Python numbers\r123456")
```
```
123456 numbers
```

# Escaping
If you need to output the special character you need to use another **backslash**

```python
print("Newline is \\n")
```
```
Newline is \n
```

# \n vs \r
**Difference between \n and \r**

\n is the newline character, while \r is the carriage return. They differ in what uses them.
Windows uses \r\n to signify the enter key was pressed, while Linux and Unix use \n.
