# About Python
Python is one of the most popular programming languages, widely used in web and game development, data analytics, data science, machine learning and much more.
# Output
The print command is the easiest way to send a specified message to the screen or other display device. This message or output can be a number, text, or the result of a calculation.
```python
print(7)
```
```
7
```
> The print command is always followed by parentheses containing the output we want to send to the screen.
# Printing Text
Computers treat text and numbers differently. When printing text outputs, you need to enclose the text in either single or double quotes
```python
print("Welcome to Python")
print('World!')
```
```
Welcome to Python!
World!
```
The text in quotes is called string.
> The quotes enclosing the text need to be the same, either both single or both double. If you forget to add the quotes or if the quotes are not the same, Python will return an error.

There are situations where you might want to print multiple messages in your code.
Each print statement outputs text in a new line
```python
print("Car List:")
print("Lamborghini")
print("Ferrari")
```
```
Car List:
Lamborghini
Ferrari
```
> Python gets its name from the BBC comedy TV series Monty Python because its creator thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious.
