# List Functions
Python has a bunch of useful built-in functions for lists.

**len()** lets you get the number of items in a list
```python
nums = [1,4,2,5,3]
print(len(nums))
```
```
5
```
> Unlike indexing items, **len** does not start with 0. The list above contains 5 items, meaning **len** will return 5

You can also use **len** on strings to return their length (character count)
```python
str = "I am the Text"
x = len(str)
print(x)
```
```
13
```
> That space is also a character

The **append()** function is used to add an item to the end of the list
```python
nums = [1,2,3]
nums.append(4)
print(nums)
```
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
> That the function is called using the list name, followed by a dot

**insert()** inserts a new item at the given position in the list
```python
words = ["Python", "simple"]
words.insert(1, "is")
print(words)
```
```
['Python', 'is', 'simple']
```
> The first argument is the position index, while the second parameter is the item to insert at that position

**index()** finds the first occurrence of a list item and returns its index
```python
letters = ['l','m','n','o','l','a']
print(letters.index('n'))
print(letters.index('l'))
print(letters.index('o'))
```
```
2
0
3
```
> An error is returned in case the specified item is not found in the list

**max**(list): Returns the maximum value.
**min**(list): Returns the minimum value.
```python
x = [1, 5, 63, 7]

print(min(x))
print(max(x))
```
```
1
63
```

list.**count**(item): Returns a count of how many times an item occurs in a list

list.**remove**(item): Removes an item from a list

list.**reverse**(): Reverses items in a list
```python
x = [2, 3, 6, 2, 5, 2, 8]
print(x.count(2))

x.remove(3)
print(x)

x.reverse()
print(x)
```
```
3
[2, 6, 2, 5, 2, 8]
[8, 2, 5, 2, 6, 2]
```
