# else Statements
The **else** statement can be used to run some statements when the condition of the **if** statement is **False**

```python
x = 5
if x == 6:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```
```
No
```
As with **if** statements, the code inside the block needs to be indented.

> The **colon** at the end **else** keyword is important, don’t leave it out.

Every **if** condition block can have only one **else** statement.
If you need to make multiple checks, we need to chain **if** and **else** statements.

For example, the following program checks and outputs the **num** variable's value as text:

```python
num = 5
if num == 3:
    print("Three")
else:
    if num == 4:
        print("Two")
    else:
        if num == 5:
            print("Five")
        else:
            print("Something else")
```
```
Five
```

> Indentation determines which **if/else** statements the code blocks belong to.

# elif Statements

Too many **if/else** statements make your code long and hard to read.

The best way to solve this is the **elif** (short for else if) statement. It’s a shortcut to use when chaining together **if** and **else** statements, making the code shorter and easier to read.

The same example from the previous part can be rewritten using **elif** statements:

```python
num = 5
if num == 3:
    print("Three")
elif num == 4:
    print("Two")
elif num == 5:
    print("Five")
else:
    print("Something else")
```
```
Five
```
A series of **if elif** statements can have a final **else** block, which is called if none of the **if** or **elif** expressions is **True**

```python
num = 10
if num == 2:
    print("Two")
elif num == 5:
    print("Five")
elif num == 8:
    print("Eight")
else:
    print("Something else")
```
```
Something else
```
