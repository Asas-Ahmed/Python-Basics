# Strings
You can create a **string** by entering text between **two single or double quotation marks**.

```python
print("Python is easy!")
print('Yeah Yeah! I know')
```
```
Python is easy!
Yeah Yeah! I know
```

> The delimiter (" or ') used for a string doesn't affect how it behaves in any way.

Everything in quotes is a string, even numbers.

```python
print("7")
```

> In the code above, 7 is a string, not an integer.

# Backslash

The backslash \ is a special character, called the escape character.
It is used to represent certain things in a string, such as new lines, tabs, and other useful things.

If you want to include a quote in a string, you need to escape it using a backslash.

```python
print("He\'s not an idiot!")
```
```
He's not an idiot!
```

> Backslashes that we use for escaping donâ€™t get displayed in the output.

You can do the same for double quotes.

```python
print("John said, \"Awesome!\"")
```
```
John said, "Awesome!"
```
